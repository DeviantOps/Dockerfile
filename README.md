# Dockerfiles

A quick way to build and run a box for coding.
Python/Conda centric, but some other goodies: Julia, Lisp...
Node ready
Some DB: mongo and redis
Login via SSH on port 2222
username: malcolm
password: malcolm (change it before first run :) )
(setup in remote.sh)

Not really elegant, but efficient
